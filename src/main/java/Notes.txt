TODO: make energy doubles

TODO: consider adding pixel class
color
horizontal energy
vertical energy

TODO: Update tests
-include a 4x4 example for energy/brightness
-include wiki page table in tables
-generate seams horizontally
-generate seams vertically
-remove horizontal seams
-remove vertical seams

TODO: Create Seam Object:
-has an array of indexes

TODO: calculate seam with the lowest energy
-seam is array of ints
-just the indexes (do not need both, one direction will be the index of the int)

TODO: Create Seam Remover
-takes in array and 2D array
-returns new 2D array

TODO: remove seam
-create new array that is width-1 and height
-Vertical seams: copy to seam and then copy after seam per row (System.ArrayCopy)
- Horizontal seams:



1. Read image into buffered image (either color[][] or int[][])
2. calculate double[][] energy
3. find the lowest energy vertical seam (or horizontal)
4. remove seam
5. Go to step 2 (until hit the number of seams you want to remove vertically and then also horizontal)


TODO: For next week:
-Energy
-Calculate Seams
-Find the lowest seam
-Remove seams
-Create new image


buffered image > 2d array of color > energy 2d >
get the lowest energy seam > remove seam from color 2d array
