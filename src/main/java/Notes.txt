TODO: update so that chooses if removing vertical or horizontal
-now it calls the remove vertical automatically in constructor
-in general, update constructors so that it does not do too much

TODO: Add tests
-generate seams horizontally
-remove horizontal seams


1. Read image into buffered image (either color[][] or int[][])
2. calculate double[][] energy
3. find the lowest energy vertical seam (or horizontal)
4. remove seam
5. Go to step 2 (until hit the number of seams you want to remove vertically and then also horizontal)

TODO: figure out how to mock tests or just call classes?

-Create new image - TODO:
-Horizontal Calculate Seams - TODO:
-Horizontal find the lowest seam - TODO:
-Remove horizontal seam - TODO:

buffered image > 2d array of color > energy 2d >
get the lowest energy seam > remove seam from color 2d array
